    Args:
        circuit: OpenQASM 2.0
        transpile (bool): True - Perform quantum circuit transpilation optimization.
                   False - No transpilation is performed, only circuit legitimacy verification is performed.
                           The qpu_name must be specified in this case.
        qpu_name (str): chip's name. If not specified, select from all available computing resources.
        qpu_id (id): chip's ID. qpu_id and qpu_name correspond one-to-one.
        qubits_list (list): A list of real physical qubits used by the specified task. e.g. [3,4,5,6]
                    When specifying 'qubits_list', you must specify either 'qpu_name' or 'qpu_id'.
        optimization_level (int):  0: Only quantum gates decomposition
                             1: Distance-based sabre algorithm (qubit mapping and routing)
                                and simple gate optimization (merging and elimination)

                                and simple gate optimization (merging and elimination)
        passflow (PassFlow): Customizing the transpilation process
        task_type (str): "qc" - quantum circuit task
                         "vqa" - Variational quantum algorithm task (subsequent versions will provide)
        repeat (int): Transpilation is repeated several times,
                      from which the best transpilation result is selected (subsequent versions will provide).
        vqpu_preferred (str): "fidelity": Choose the VQPU with the highest fidelity.
                              "structure": Choose the VQPU whose qubits coupling structure best matches the task.
